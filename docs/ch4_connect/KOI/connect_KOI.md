# Using KOI to connect to MakerCloud
- KOI is a graphically programmable offline artificial intelligence module developed by Xiaomiao Technology for primary and secondary school students and STEM enthusiasts. 
- The hardware includes lenses, microphones, speakers, IPS screen modules, Wi-Fi modules, etc. 
- It has many capabilities, including but not limited to visual recognition, voice recognition, speech synthesis, and Internet of Things. 
- WiFi functionality is integrated, allowing your artificial intelligence work to connect to an online cloud.

#### Connecting to micro:bit
This tutorial will use micro:bit to connect to KOI. On Kittenbot's official teaching website, there are detailed connection instructions:

## MakerCloud KOI Extension
While there are MQTT blocks in the KOI extension, they are difficult to use. In order to facilitate an easy connection to MakerCloud, we have written a special MakeCode extension for MakerCloud KOI.

#### Makecode for micro:bit
After connecting KOI to your micro:bit, start programming on MakeCode:

#### Create a new project

#### Add KOI extension
The MakerCloud KOI extension must be used with Kittenbot's KOI extension.

1. Click "Advanced" -> "Extensions"
2. Copy and paste the "KOI" extension link:

#### Add MakerCloud KOI Extension
After adding the KOI expansion, add the MakerCloud KOI expansion. This way, KOI can use its Wi-Fi capability to connect to MakerCloud via MQTT.
1. Click "Advanced" -> "Extensions"
2. Copy and paste the "Koi" extension link

#### Connect to Wi-Fi and MakerCloud
**When started**
First, program KOI to connect to Wi-Fi and MakerCloud via MQTT when the micro:bit is started.

1. Setting the pin
2. Connect Wi-Fi settings: Enter SSID and password
3. Pause for 5 seconds to ensure that the Wi-Fi connection is successful
4. Connect to MakerCloud via MQTT
5. Pause for 2 seconds to ensure that the MakerCloud-MQTT connection is successful

After completing the programming, download the program to your micro:bit. If you donâ€™t know how to download code to micro:bit, refer to the following tutorial webpage:
[https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/set-up/]()

After successfully connecting to MakerCloud, the user can program the micro:bit to perform other MQTT commands.
**Note that you must first connect Wi-Fi and MakerCloud MQTT every time you program.**
