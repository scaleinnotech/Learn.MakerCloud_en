# Using App Inventor 2 to Connect to MakerCloud

[TOC]

## MakerCloud AI2 extension
- Since App Inventor 2 does not use MQTT, you need to download the extension before connecting via MQTT.
- To facilitate using AI2, we have made a special extension for MakerCloud connecting to AI2:

[MakerCloud AI2 extension](extension/scale.MakerCloud.aix) (right click to save as new fileï¼‰
