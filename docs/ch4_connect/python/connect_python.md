## MQTT with MakerCloud using Python
Although Python has a library that supports MQTT, there may be issues when you use it. 

To better facilitate the connection to MakerCloud, we have written MakerCloudMQTT Library.
First, download the MakerCloud Python Library:  
[MakerCloudMQTT Library](library/MakerCloudMQTT.zip)

#### Installation
You must **install** these pieces of software before using MakerCloudMQTT:

1. Python
2. Paho MQTT

##### Installing Python
Users can download the installer from the official Python website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After downloading, open the installer and follow the instructions to install Python.

##### Installing Paho MQTT
MakerCloudMQTT uses Paho MQTT, so you need to install Paho MQTT first.
Open the Terminal or DOS program, and enter:
```
pip install paho-mqtt
```
## Connecting MakerCloud
1. Create a python project called "main.py"
2. Unzip "MakerCloudMQTT.zip"
3. Copy "MakerCloudMQTT.py" and paste it in the same directory of "main.py"
4. Import MakerCloudMQTT.py
5. Set the Username to Max

#### What the code looks like:
```python
import MakerCloudMQTT

MakerCloudMQTT.username = 'Max' 
```
