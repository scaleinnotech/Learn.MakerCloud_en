### Using and Customizing a Dashboard

- Underneath your new dashboard, you will see the charts you have most recently used or created. 
- By clicking on the 3 dots in the top right corners of the chart icons, you can then add them to the dashboard.
- This feature is available with any chart or widget you are using in MakerCloud, not just the ones that have been recently used
- Once you have added a chart or charts to your dashboard, reload the webpage to see your charts populate the dashboard.
- From your dashboard, you can still access the detail pages of the charts on your dashboard.

The Dashboard is a helpful feature for users as they can coordinate different charts, widgets, and data sources.
It is especially helpful for gauge and plain text charts as the user can constantly monitor those charts with ease.
